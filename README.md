**About Me:**

As an UAB student, I am expected to graduate with a Master's in Computer Science and Cyber Security Analytics Security in Spring 2025. Currently, I work at UAB 1917 Clinic at Dewberry as an IT Helpdesk Technician for around two years. Here, I maintain, update, and eliminate vulnerabilities for over 300 users and computers and provide assistance to individuals over the phone, through email, and in-person. A personal project that I am working on is a local and multiplayer game using Unity, C#, .NET, and object-oriented principles. I have also worked at Publix for three years as a Deli Clerk, Produce Clerk, and in Customer Service. Here, I have learned the importance of teamwork, providing premiere customer service, and being adaptable and teachable.As an UAB student, I am expected to graduate with a Master's in Computer Science and Cyber Security Analytics Security in Spring 2025.
