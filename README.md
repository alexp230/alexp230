**About Me:**
Currently, I am a senior at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), pursuing a Computer Science (BS) degree with a minor in Mathematics. At UAB, I am glad to have the opportunity to learn about computers, algorithms, coding languages, programs, applications, how to satisfy customers or clients, and how to work with group/team members in an effective way. Whether it be building a full-fledged video game or building a website, allowing the users to create and login in to their account, make purchases and finalize their transactions, using SQLite and various databases, I have had a blast learning alongside my friends and I am ready to use what I have learned in the near future.
While pursuing my degree, I work at the 1917 Clinic at Dewberry as an IT HelpDesk Specialist. There, I help the employees with problems that may occur while they are working. Here, providing great customer service, making sure to properly explain directions, and to have great communication is of utmost importance to me. Here, I also will try and reduce the amount of vulnerabilities on the computers of the employees who work there.
