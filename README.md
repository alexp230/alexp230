**About Me:**
In Fall 2023, I graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science (BS) and a minor in Mathematics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and currently, I am a graduate student at the UAB pursuing a masters in Computer Science and a Cyber Security Analytics Certificate, expecting to graduate with both in Spring 2025. Being at UAB, I am glad to have the opportunity to learn about computers, algorithms, coding languages, programs, applications, how to satisfy customers or clients needs, and how to work with group/team members in an effective way. Whether it be building a full-fledged video game, building a website, or some other type of program/project, I have had a blast learning alongside my friends and I am ready to use what I have learned in the real world.
